# Celo Chatroom DApp

This is a decentralized chatroom DApp built using Next.js and Celo blockchain. Users can pay a membership fee to become a member and access the chatroom to chat with other members using Celo blockchain. The DApp also uses Solidity, React, and Rainbowkit.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DApp, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Metamask Extension for Chrome or Firefox

To install the DApp, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start a development server at http://localhost:3000.


## Usage
To use the DApp, you need to have a Celo account and some CELO Alfajores tokens. You can take CELO tokens from a testnet faucet.

Once you have CELO tokens, you can connect your Celo wallet to the DApp and pay the membership fee to become a member. After becoming a member, you can access the chatroom and start chatting with other members.
